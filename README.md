# Mobile App Description
        --- MovieFinder App ---
        Our application helps users find a movie to watch by recommending movies to them based 
        on certain filters they input. The most popular/recent movies will be suggested.
        Users will be able to create, read, update, and/or delete their accounts which will store
        their name, email, password, previously watched list, and watch later list. 
        
        Once logged in then the user will be directed to a welcome page where they can either sign 
        out or 'Find Movies'. If they choose to find movies then they will be prompted to choose an
        overall category of movies they wish to generate and a specific category. For example) they
        could choose to generate movie recommendations based on 'Genre' in the 'Comedy' Genre.
        They will also be prompted to enter the number of movie recommendations they wish to be 
        generated. They can only generate up to 20 movie recommendations at a time. This max may 
        vary if a user has many movies on their previously watched list. Then the user
        can click the generate button or shake their phone in order to generate the movies. This 
        will lead the user to recommended movies, found on The Movie Database, based on their
        filtered fields where they can see the movie posters and also learn more about each movie.
        
        Users will have a Previously Watched list and a Watch Later list associated with their accounts.
        This means that a user can add a generated movie to their Previously Watched list so that that
        movie will no longer be recommended to them. Or they could add a movie to their Watch Later list
        where titles will be highlighted when later recommended. Users can view each list by clicking the 
        3 dots on the navigation/tool bar where they can also remove a certain movie from a list if they wish.
